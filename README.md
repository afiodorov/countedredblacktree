# Red Black Tree With Counts

This is a copy of [gods](https://github.com/afiodorov/countedredblacktree) that modifies the Red Black Tree so that each node:

* Keeps counts of children
* Is no longer associated with a value
* Can be repeated many times

Possible usecase: quickly counting number of items less or smaller than some field.
